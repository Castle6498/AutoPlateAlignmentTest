Welp TODO List Here FOlks:
^this seems like it was made by Grant Huey
Poll: Pancakes: ||||
      Waffles:
the blax dont exist

Poll: Krish:
      Teacher:||||


1) What does it take to wire up non addressable LEDS w/ ROBORIO?
    What colors, any analog possible through PWM? 
    Want something pretty, just not individually addressable, the single ones
    Neeed it to connect straight to roboRIO 
2) Get all the ticks per inch values AND soft limit estimates (estimate low plz :D )
    Lift - include gearbox, radius of sprocket, 
        and stage conversion (I think 1 inch of chain = 2 inch on lift???)
    Wrist - Gear box would be ticks per degrees, whoever does this go in the program
        and rename all places of ticks per inch ONLY FOR WRIST and convert to degrees 
    Plate Center - gear box, Belt pulley
    Suspension - gear box, belt (see if pullies different sizes), incline for the threading on bar
3) Get a reading from the LIDAR sensors
    Double check wiring
    Make sure arduino doesn't short
    Run tester program
    Test the plate centering code

4) Make a kick butt test program
    Tests for each subsystem individually using selector in dashboard
    Teleop for each subsystem action 
    Print outs like everywhere, include like all the info
    But have annoying prints turn off when not in test mode 
    Try to make sure they don't spam soo much, maybe make it print
    out about every other time, I need this to be flexible and organized for quick
    changes and testing between matches 
5) Figure out what the heck goes in the stupid superstructure
    Want to make sure plate centered when using Balls
    Make Balls low when using plate
    Make plate and Balls low and center when Climbing
    Is superstructure necessary???? - no just disable drive
    base when you are climbing in ****teleOP**** code :D 

6) How to run an Autonomous teleop based

    Initialize it:
        try {
                CrashTracker.logAutoInit();

                System.out.println("Auto start timestamp: " + Timer.getFPGATimestamp());

                if (mAutoModeExecuter != null) {
                    mAutoModeExecuter.stop();
                }

                zeroAllSensors();
                mSuperstructure.setWantedState(Superstructure.WantedState.IDLE);
            
                mAutoModeExecuter = null;

            
                
                mEnabledLooper.start();
                //mSuperstructure.reloadConstants();
                mAutoModeExecuter = new AutoModeExecuter();
                mAutoModeExecuter.setAutoMode(AutoModeSelector.getSelectedAutoMode());
                mAutoModeExecuter.start();

            } catch (Throwable t) {
                CrashTracker.logThrowableCrash(t);
                throw t;
            }
    Stop it:
        if (mAutoModeExecuter != null) {
            mAutoModeExecuter.stop();
        }
        mAutoModeExecuter = null;

7) Is the silly sandstorm in the auto period?
    Maybe look in rules manual?
    Or the forums...
8) What are your goals with the LED lights
    Plate Mechanism:
        Aligned: flash green
        Can't Reach: flash red
        Deploying: flash blue
        Centered: solid green
        centering, aligning - flash blue 
        homing: solid Red
    Ball control helper:
        At position: solid - green
        Moving: flash blue 
        Intake/Shoot: Flash green 
        homing: solid red 
    Suspension:
        Homing - red if unique one
        If unique - idle green  
        Climbing: entire robot flash blue 
        Done: flash green 
        MAKE LED an auto command
    Stop/default command:
        solid - blue, everything
